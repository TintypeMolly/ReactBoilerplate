# react-boilerplate

My small react boilerplate.  
I want to make an universal(isomorphic) app project template using [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/).  
This repo is hugely influenced by [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) of [Kriasoft](https://github.com/kriasoft).

## Why I made this

I used [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) when I first met [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and found it too complicated to read.  
I managed to publish an universal app with its help, but I still don't understand its structure.  
So I decided to make a very simple and easy universal react app boilerplate.
