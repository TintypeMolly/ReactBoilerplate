# react-boilerplate

**ON CONSTRUCTION**  
**DO NOT FORK THIS REPO YET SINCE I FREQUENTLY AMEND, MERGE, REBASE AND DO SHITS**

## Description

My small react boilerplate.  
I am targeting an Isomorphic App using react, redux.  
This repo is hugely influenced by [react-starter-kit of Kriasoft](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit).

## Why I made this

I used `react-starter-kit` when I first met `node` and `react`, and found it is very complicated.  
I managed to publish an isomorphic app with its help, but I still don't understand the structure.  
So I decided to make a very simple and easy isomorphic boilerplate.
